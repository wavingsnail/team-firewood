2 or 3 people.
======================================================
Goal: 
	- Find a treasure.
Actions: 
	- get Treasure (requires advice)
	- Ask for advice (requires being in 2nd part of map) => get advice
	- Open door (requires key & door is locked) => reach 2nd part of map, door is locked again
	- Bash wall (requires strength > x) => reach 2nd part of map
	- Dig (no pre conditions) => may find key (POI dependent)
		* To make simulations different: randomize #keys (e.g. hasKey = randbool(0.2))
	- Do push ups (no preconditions) => strength ++
		* Only action in simulation for which RequiresInRange() returns false
	
POI's (points of interest) in the world: 
======================================================
1st part of map:
	- Place where you can dig (once!) and find/not find a key.
		* To make simulations different: randomize "time to dig" (e.g. randinrange(0,5))
	- Door which you can open using a key
	- Wall theat you can bash

2nd part of map:
	- Creature walking around from which you can get advice as to where's the treasure
		* Creature is both a character & POI
		Creature's goal: 
			- Reach nirvana > x
		Create's actions: 
			- Meditate on mountain (requires mushrooms > x) => nirvana ++, mushrooms = 0
				* Takes a long time
			- Collect mushrooms (no preconditions) => mushrooms ++
		
		* Idea: creature can only give advice when it has reached nirvana > x

	- Mountain where you can meditate
		* Should be far away from treasure
	- Mushroom valley, where you can collect mushrooms
